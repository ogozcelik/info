I attended the 4th Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2023) in Vienna. I presented our paper "Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Misinformation Detection:
Investigating Performance Across Multiple Languages" under the 1st International Workshop on Disinformation and Toxic Content
Analysis (DiTox 2023), which can be accessed via <a href="https://doi.org/10.34619/srmk-injj">NOVA Research Portal</a>.
